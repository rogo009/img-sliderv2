// target the slides

// target the buttons

// create variables for auto scroll and interval time

// this project is to create function(s) that add or remove a class name called 'current' to make images appear or disappear if button is clicked and / or when auto scroll is activated to "true"

// you have to apply a class that tracks the slides and applies or removes the class based on certaion conditions

// resetting the interval prevented the slide /img (if the user clicked before 5 seconds passed) from being shown less than 5 seconds. each click ensures each slide will always have a 5 second interval re-applied upon each button click

// this project has images as background, so the imgs were implemented into the css file
